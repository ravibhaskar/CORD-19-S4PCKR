    "# I. Introduction\n",
    "  \n",
    "> In a pandemic situation, clinicians and researchers are in urgent need of rapid and quality information that will help them to inform diagnostics and therapeutics relating to the disease. Traditional research models producing trustworthy and methodologically sound results takes time, which does not fit well with a pandemic context where research has to be fast-tracked. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the volume and velocity of scientific information that can be produced in a short period of time. For COVID-19, some of these traditional delays have been circumvented as many medical journals have prioritized publications related to COVID-19 and there is greater use of preprint servers to make research findings immediately available in an open format. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Whilst not everything posing as trustworthy research is truly so, medical literature (pre-print and otherwise) is yet an important source of information in the pandemic context. However, staying current with the growing body of literature is a challenge. Generally, when publishing their research, the authors indicate what other work has been done in the past, describe their data and results and cite previous literature to support or refute their interpretation of the data. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and clinicians require a reliable model to mine published literature for novel insights, emerging risk factors and therapeutics to inform their work in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, we present an innovative text mining and analytical tool that will aid clinicians and researchers in extracting valuable insights from large datasets of literature. In the following sections, we describe the principles, techniques and results of our approach."

    "> # II. Approach\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Information retrieval, in a text mining context, involves a user submitting a query to a search engine and receiving relevant results aligning with their submitted query in return. In a pandemic context, information extraction from medical literature involves the identification of entities such as diseases, as well as the identification of complex relationships between these entities. Query results extracted from the literature may be used for the purposes of populating databases or data curation. From these extractions, knowledge bases can be built that contain the collected statements with references to the literature. Knowledge discovery involves identifying undiscovered or hidden knowledge by applying data-mining algorithms to the collection of facts gathered from the literature. From here, text mining results may be used to suggest new hypotheses which can be used to either validate or disprove existing hypotheses or to help direct future research. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> For the purpose of the task, we formed a team including **data scientists, software engineers, clinicians and medical researchers** to enable a credible and informed approach in developing the text-mining model. Our text-mining model automates the knowledge discovery process aiding researchers and clinicians in their pursuit of appropriate treatment and management of COVID-19 cases. This process is achieved by identifying whether a given medical article is related to COVID-19, and it’s relevance to the competition task of identifying clinical risk factors embedded in the literature. The assumption here is that supplied databases collectively have relevant information suitable for extraction. While the tool we developed here was customised to automatically identify COVID19 related risk factors, this model can be potentially expanded to extract useful information from medical literature and building knowledge bases. Key steps involved in building the solution are -\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     1. All documents provided in the CORD19 Data were pre-processed, by grabbing all sections within documents and categorising them appropriately into Introduction, Discussion, Results OR Results and Discussions fields. \n",
    "> \n",
    ">     2. Introduction, Discussion and Results were merged to form another field/column called the Body.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     3. All documents that don't have Abstract and Body were dropped - which means they don’t have any of Intro/Discussion/Body.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     4. All documents were indexed into a search engine (acting as the data corpus from which information is extracted).\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     5. Once the tasks are queried- results are displayed and a knowledge discovery process is applied to the extracted information to gain relevant entities and valuable insights. Using those entities - algorithms are applied and graphs like Principal Component Analysis and Temporal Value Affinity charts are plotted. \n",

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss.You can read more about PCA [here](https://medium.com/@aptrishu/understanding-principle-component-analysis-e32be0253ef0).\n",

    "  Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. It tries to make the inter-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible. It assigns data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the cluster’s centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data points that belong to that cluster) is at the minimum. The less variation we have within clusters, the more homogeneous (similar) the data points are within the same cluster.<br>\n",

Solr provides distributed indexing and load-balanced querying, which suits the challenge objectives.

Initially, key terms aligning with COVID-19 including all its associated synonyms were built into the search process to filter results. The search process then incorporated the SciSpacy NER model to further filter the results. "

In this methodology, bodies of all the papers related to the search query are passed through the SciSpacy Biomedical models to extract specialised medical entities from them. These terms are then converted to a “document - entity” matrix wherein each value of the matrix would display the count of the particular entity in a paper. Each entity would become a feature of the document and since it is not necessary that all entities would be present in all documents, we get a sparse matrix ( a matrix in which most of the elements are 0) as an output\n",
